# Subscriptions
Parents are looking for very cheap options for toys, and getting parents to pay more then $5 for something at the markets seems to have little to no success. This can be frustrating for toy designers who want to incorporate high end materials and technology into their product. Therefore, looking to cheap toys with subscription models is an interesting approach.

Ex. A toy w/ accompanying freemium app (where paying for updates unlocks exciting features)
